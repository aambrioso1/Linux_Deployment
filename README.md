# Linux_Deployment

This repository contains code and documentation for deploying an app running that runs on the local host to the web.

It will contain code and a script for the following:
(1) Setting up a Reverse Proxy
(2) Securing the App with HTTPS

I will be following this nice article by Imran Remtulla [local host to .com ...](https://medium.com/swlh/localhost-to-com-deploying-a-web-app-for-beginners-ea05b0213eb7).

I should be able to quickly deploy an app that I can run on the localhost using the service, nginx.conf, and the script in the repo.   

Next I would like to deploy the Lektor static CMS for a personal blog as well as any other apps I happen to be developing.
