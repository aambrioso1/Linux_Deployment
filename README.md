# Linux_Deployment
This repository will contain code and documentation for deploying an app running on a local host to the web.

It will contain code and a script for the following
Setting up a Reverse Proxy
Securing the App with HTTPS

I will be following this nice article, [local host to .com ...](https://medium.com/swlh/localhost-to-com-deploying-a-web-app-for-beginners-ea05b0213eb7), by Imran Remtulla. 

I will use the repository to deploy some simple apps.   Ultimately, I would like to deploy the Lektor static CMS for a personal blog as well as any other experimental that I am working on.
